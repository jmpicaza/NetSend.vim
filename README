Plugin for sending messages with the 'net send' MS command.
It keeps the name of the users you send messages in a file and you can access them with the <tab> key.
Navigation through menu (Plugin->NetSend->...) you can send messages, add users and remove them.
You can also open the file with the user names and edit directly.

Usage:
----------
You can use the menu in "Plugin->NetSend-> or:
Insert ':NetSend user_name message to this user'
    and user_name will reicive a message saying: 'myUser says: message to this user'
Insert :NetSent <tab> to see the list of users you have stored.
Insert :NetSent r<tab> to see all the users beginning by 'r'
Insert: NetSendCC user1 user2 user3<ENTER>
    to send the same message to several users at a time (or :NetSendBCC if you wish)

To edit the list of users just open the file used in the g:NetSend_File. You can do it Typing :EditNetSend

TODO: write the unix/linux version (smbclient -M MS-Windows-host-name OR talk)
